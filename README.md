### BheemSense Patient Monitoring and Management app frontend design

This is a web frontend prototype for the BheemSense App, containing: 
* Patient dashboard page
* Patient overview page
* Patient information page
* User task list page + timetable
  * Includes task modal for task creation
* Waterlow scale survey page for each patient
* Patient allergies page
* Patient conditions page

An unfinished component in "Heatmap.jsx" was created to read and visualise feedback from a real Pressure Sensor Mattress design, however the colour grid has been set randomly for now, 
and more research onto which specific pressure values denote what levels of risk will need to be done, for a more accurate heatmap. 

Other components designed: 
* Footbar
* Modal
* NavBar
* Page Title

Languages: 
* JavaScript

Frameworks: 
* React, Material UI

Essential code components can be found in /app/src.
